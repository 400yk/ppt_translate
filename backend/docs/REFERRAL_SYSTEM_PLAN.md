# Referral and Feedback System Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a referral system that allows users to recommend Translide to friends and earn extra membership weeks. Also collect user feedback through a popup interface.

## Core Features
- Bottom popup with referral and feedback options
- **Generic shareable referral links** (no email required upfront)
- **First come, first served** referral code usage
- Extra membership rewards for successful referrals (3 days for both users)
- Feedback collection and storage
- Database tracking of referral relationships

## Referral System Approach
**✅ Option B: Generic Shareable Links**
- Users generate generic referral codes without requiring referee emails
- Links can be shared freely in social media, group chats, etc.
- First person to register with a code becomes the referee
- More user-friendly and viral potential
- Standard industry approach
