# LinguaSlides

# Project Description

LinguaSlides is a web application designed to seamlessly translate PowerPoint presentations (PPT/PPTX files) between Chinese and English. Leveraging cutting-edge AI technology, the platform enables users to effortlessly convert their presentations from one language to another, maintaining the structure and formatting of the original slides.

Users can easily upload their PPT/PPTX files directly to LinguaSlides, and the AI engine will process the content, translating all text within the slides. Once the translation is complete, users can download the newly translated presentation in PPT/PPTX format.

The website features a clean and intuitive user interface, with a primary light blue color scheme complemented by teal accents, creating a modern and professional aesthetic.
